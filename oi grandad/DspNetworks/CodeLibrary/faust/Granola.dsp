    Granola is a monophonic granular live feed processor.

    The grain processor is inspired by the Mutable Instruments Beads. The grain window shape control
    is inspired by the GR-1 Granular synthesizer from Tasty Chips Electronics.

    #### Specifications

    * Audio I/O
        - Manual input and output gain control.
        - Recording time: `BUFFER_DURATION`.
        - The FREEZE button freezes the content of the recording table.
        - Feedback path with attenuation and limiter (with 1 sample delay). The feedback signal comes from
          the grains output (it's before the dry/wet crossfader).
        - Dry/Wet control.
        - TODO: Stereo I/O with automatic level detection with a limiter.
        - TODO: Gate signal in sync with the grains.
        - TODO: Antialiased output.
        - TODO: Spatialized output.
    * Grains generation modes
        - The SEED button triggers a grain.
        - Automatically trigger grains at a periodic rate with the DENSITY parameter (at maximum density
          there are 1000 grains generated per second (M.I. Beads has a maximum rate of ~260 grains per second).  
        Note: The actual number of triggered grains cannot exceed the `CONCURRENT_GRAINS` value (30 for M.I. Beads).
        - TODO: Automatically trigger grains at a randomized rate.
        - TODO: Start a chain of delayed and pitched grains instead of a single one.
    * Grain parameters
        - TIME: Controls the playback position of each grain within the table. In other words, it delays the grains. 
        - SIZE: Grain duration from 0.03 seconds to the table length, forward or backward playback.
        - SHAPE: The shape of the grain envelope. The shape control allows to morph the shape from a square
          (in this case the grain original amplitude is maintained), to an inverted saw (slow release), to a triangle
          (attack and release time are the same), and finally to a saw (slow attack).
        - PITCH: The pitch of the grain (-2..+2 octaves).  
        Note: The four grain parameters are latched when a grain is triggered. Hence, the grain parameters
              remain the same throughout the grain playback but they may differ for multiple grains.
        - TODO: TIME slew limiter for tape like scrubing effect.

    #### Usage

    ```
    _ : Granola(BUFFER_DURATION, CONCURRENT_GRAINS).ui(uix) : _
    ```

    Where:

    * `BUFFER_DURATION`: buffer duration in seconds.
    * `CONCURRENT_GRAINS`: (int) number of grains allocated.
    * `uix`: (int) the UI instance number.

    // It has a 1 second audio buffer and up to 30 grains playing a the same time.
    process = Granola(1, 30).ui(0);

    ```

    ```
    // As the Granola grain processor is able to play many copies of the input signal simultaneously,
    // it may rapidly saturate its output. This could be avoided by manualy reducing the output gain,

          edge is immediatly followed by the falling edge and, when the plateau width equals 1, rising and falling 
          edge are instantaneous.
