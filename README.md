## **Oi, Grandad!**

Oi, Grandad! is a 4 voice granular synthesiser inspired by modular synthesis and certain, "lazy" DAW compositon workflows.

# Known issues

When using Logic Pro 10.7.x it is necessary to use a buffer size of 512 or higher, a lower buffer will cause the position modulation to behave incorrectly. 10.6.3 should work with any buffer size.

It is reccomended to use samples of 3 seconds or larger, shorter files may cause crashes or audio dropouts.


# Installation

 **Linux**
 
 Copy oi grandad.vst3 to User/Home/vst3
 
 copy modularsamples to User/Home/.config


 **Windows**

Copy oi grandad.vst3 to C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3

Copy the modularsamples folder to C:\Users/YOURNAME/AppData/Roaming/

 **Mac**
 
Open the DMG file and then open the file "Oi Grandad.mkpg". If you get a message saying "“Oi Grandad.mpkg” cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer." Right click on the package and select "open" instead.

On loading your DAW you may see a message saying “the developer cannot be verified” to fix this open System Preferences → Security and Privacy. On the general tab click ‘Open anyway’.
