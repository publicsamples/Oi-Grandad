# Installation

Simply open the DMG file and then open the file "Oi Grandad.mkpg". If you get a message saying "“Oi Grandad.mpkg” cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer." Right click on the package and select "open" instead.

On loading your DAW you may see a message saying “the developer cannot be verified” to fix this open System Preferences → Security and Privacy. On the general tab click ‘Open anyway’.
